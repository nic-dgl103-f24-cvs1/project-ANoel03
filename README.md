Project Website Plan Content
Project Summary
State what site you have chosen to redesign and build and include the URL.
Explain why the client needs a new website:
What is the most important purpose of this website?
Who is the target audience? Perhaps there are multiple target audiences?
What is the overall message you are trying to convey to your target audience on this website? 
What action do you want the audience to perform before they leave your website? Are there multiple ways they could take action? 
Why is their current site not appropriate? There could be many reasons to do with accessibility, speed, design, content, or responsiveness.
Look and Feel
Describe how you will approach the design elements of the website. 
Mood: What are some specific visual moods the site should convey?
Inspiration: Research and include homepage screenshots and urls of 2 website designs that you feel are good inspiration for the redesign of your website because they communicate similar moods to what you want your website to convey.
Colours: Are there any brand colours that you can use? List at least 3 colours that you plan to use in your redesign.
Images: Is there a logo, photos, icons or illustrations that can be used from the original site?
Fonts: Are there any brand typefaces that you can reuse? List 2 font-families that you plan to use in your redesign.
Website Content
You only need to build 3 pages, including the homepage. For those 3 pages write a content list for each page. 
Review the Website Technical Requirements from the Project Overview document to ensure that you have included all the content you need.
Once you know what content you will include in your website, you can use wireframes to figure out what each content block’s layout could look like.
