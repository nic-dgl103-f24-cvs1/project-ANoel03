            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>
              Welcome to Kehler Vegetable Company! We are a family-owned, small
              mixed market farm. Nestled in the heart of Black Creek, our farm
              sits on 20-acres in the scenic Comox Valley. We are committed to
              growing high-quality, seasonal produce that nourishes both our
              neighbours and the land we care for. We take great pride in
              growing fresh, nutrient-dense produce, all while using sustainable
              farming practices that support the health of the ecosystem. We
              proudly provide fresh vegetables, berries, and eggs from our
              pasture. Passionate about supporting our community, we're
              committed to offering the best local produce. Whether you’re here
              to pick up seasonal vegetables, fresh berries, or our
              pasture-raised eggs, we’re excited to share what we grow with you!

      <!-- COMMUNITY AND EVENTS -->

        <h2>community and events</h2>
        <p>
          At Kehler Vegetable Company, we believe that farming is about more
          than just growing food— it's about building connections, supporting
          sustainability, and nurturing a healthier, more vibrant community.
          That's why we actively participate in local events and host gatherings
          at our farm that celebrate not only the bounty of the land, but also
          the values that matter most to us: sustainability, minimalism, and
          living in harmony with nature. Throughout the year, we host a variety
          of events designed to bring people together around healthy living and
          local agriculture. From hands-on workshops about growing your own
          vegetables and creating sustainable gardens, to cooking classes
          focused on plant-based recipes using fresh, seasonal ingredients, our
          events aim to inspire and empower our community to make mindful
          choices about the food they eat and how they live.
        </p>
